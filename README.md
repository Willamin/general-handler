# handlebars

A generalized version of (and _heavily_ inspired by) the HTTP::Sever::Handler. With some additional work, it could even replace the heavylifting of the HTTP::Server::Handler. I know the specs aren't exactly specs, but `$ crystal spec` runs the "example" to make sure everything works fine.
